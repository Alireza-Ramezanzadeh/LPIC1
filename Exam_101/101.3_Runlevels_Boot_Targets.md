[101.3 Change runlevels / boot targets and shutdown or reboot the system](./101.3_Runlevels_Boot_Targets.md)
======================================================================================================================================================

_Weight: 3_

Description: Candidates should be able to manage the SysVinit runlevel or systemd boot target of the system. This objective includes changing to single-user mode, and shutdown or rebooting the system. Candidates should be able to alert users before switching runlevels / boot targets and properly terminate processes. This objective also includes setting the default SysVinit runlevel or systemd boot target. It also includes awareness of Upstart as an alternative to SysVinit or systemd.

Key Knowledge Areas:
--------------------

* Set the default runlevel or boot target.
* Change between runlevels / boot targets including single-user mode.
* Shutdown and reboot from the command line.
* Alert users before switching runlevels / boot targets or other major system events.
* Properly terminate processes.
* Awareness of acpi.

The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* `/etc/inittab`
* `shutdown`
* `init`
* `/etc/init.d/`
* `telinit`
* `systemd`
* `systemctl`
* `/etc/systemd/`
* `/usr/lib/systemd/`
* `wall`

runlevels
---------

Runlevels define what tasks can be accomplished in the current state (or runlevel) of a Linux system. Think of it as different stages of _being alive_.

### systemd

On systemd, we have different targets which are groups of services:

```shell
root@debian:~# systemctl list-units --type=target
  UNIT                   LOAD    ACTIVE  SUB     DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------
  basic.target          loaded  active  active  Basic System
  cryptsetup.target     loaded  active  active  Local Encrypted Volumes
  getty.target          loaded  active  active  Login Prompts
  graphical.target      loaded  active  active  Graphical Interface
  local-fs-pre.target   loaded  active  active  Local File Systems (Pre)
  local-fs.target       loaded  active  active  Local File Systems
  multi-user.target     loaded  active  active  Multi-User System
  network.target        loaded  active  active  Network
  paths.target          loaded  active  active  Paths
  remote-fs.target      loaded  active  active  Remote File Systems
  slices.target         loaded  active  active  Slices
  sockets.target        loaded  active  active  Sockets
  sound.target          loaded  active  active  Sound Card
  swap.target           loaded  active  active  Swap
  sysinit.target        loaded  active  active  System Initialization
  time-set.target       loaded  active  active  System Time Set
  time-sync.target      loaded  active  active  System Time Synchronized
  timers.target         loaded  active  active  Timers
```

Check the default target or the status of each:

```shell
root@debian:~# systemctl get-default
graphical.target

root@debian:~# systemctl status multi-user.target
‚óè multi-user.target - Multi-User System
  Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target; static)
  Active: active since Sat 2022-05-07 11:58:36 EDT; 4h 24min left
  Docs: man:systemd.special(7)
```

Isolate targets or move to special targets:

1. `rescue`: Local file systems are mounted, no networking, root-user only (_maintenance_ mode).
2. `emergency`: Only the root file system in read-only mode, no networking, root-user only.
3. `reboot`
4. `halt`: Stops all processes and halts CPU activities.
5. `poweroff`: Like halt but also sends an ACPI shutdown signal.

```shell
# systemctl isolate emergency
Welcome to emergency mode! After logging in, type "journalctl -xb" to view system logs, "systemctl reboot" to reboot, "systemctl default" or ^D to try again to boot into default mode.
Give root password for maintenance
(or type Control-D to continue):
#
# systemctl is-system-running
maintenance
```

### SysV runlevels

On SysV, runlevels define stages:

**Red Hat-based systems:**

* 0 - Shutdown
* 1 - Single-user mode (recovery); Also called S or s
* 2 - Multi-user without networking
* 3 - Multi-user with networking
* 4 - Customizable by admin
* 5 - Multi-user with networking and graphics
* 6 - Reboot

**Debian-based systems:**

* 0 - Shutdown
* 1 - Single-user mode
* 2 - Multi-user mode with graphics
* 6 - Reboot

Check the current runlevel with `runlevel`. On SysV systems, defaults were set in `/etc/inittab`:

```shell
grep "^id:" /etc/inittab
id:5:initdefault:
```

Runlevels can also be controlled using kernel parameters or `telinit`:

```shell
# runlevel
N 3
# telinit 5
# runlevel
3 5
# init 0  # shutdown the system
```

Runlevel files are in `/etc/init.d` and `/etc/rc[0-6].d`.

### `/etc/inittab`

Deprecated but part of the exam:

```plaintext
# inittab - Describes how the INIT process should set up the system in a certain run-level.
id:5:initdefault:
```

Stopping the system
-------------------

Use the `shutdown` command to alert users and safely terminate processes:

* `-h`: Halt the system.
* `-r`: Reboot the system.
* Time options: `hh:mm`, `n` (minutes), or `now`.

```shell
shutdown -r 60 Reloading updated kernel
```

Advanced options:

* `-t60`: Delay 60 seconds between SIGTERM and SIGKILL.
* Cancel shutdown: `shutdown -c`.

### Halt, reboot, and poweroff

* `halt`: Stops the system.
* `poweroff`: Stops and powers off the system.
* `reboot`: Stops and reboots the system.

### Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)

ACPI allows power management and hardware discovery. Shutdown commands send signals to power off the system.

### Notifying users

Tools for system notifications:

* `wall`: Send messages to logged-in users.
* `/etc/issue`: Displayed on tty terminal login.
* `/etc/issue.net`: Displayed on remote terminal login.
* `/etc/motd`: Message of the day after login.
* `mesg`: Enable or disable wall messages.

Systemctl sends wall messages for events like emergency, halt, power-off, reboot, and rescue.
