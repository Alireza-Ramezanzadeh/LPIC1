* Tools and utilities to manipulate USB devices
* Conceptual understanding of `sysfs`, `udev`, `dbus`
* `/sys`
* `/proc`
* `/dev`
* `modprobe`
* `lsmod`
* `lspci`
* `lsusb`

## Find out about the hardware

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. It sits on top of the hardware and manages the resources when other software (sometimes called a userspace program) asks for it.

Firmware is the software on your hardware that runs it; think of it as a built-in OS or driver for your hardware. Motherboards need some firmware to be able to work too.

Firmware is a type of software that lives in hardware. Software is any program or group of programs run by a computer.

## Peripheral Devices

These are device interfaces.

### PCI

Peripheral Component Interconnect. Enables the user to add extra components to the Motherboard. Now most servers use PCI Express (PCIe).

* Internal HDD:
  * PATA (old)
  * SATA (serial & up to 4 devices) (II-III)
  * SCSI (parallel & up to 8 devices) (Small Computer System Interface)
* External HDD: Fiber (providing a high-speed data connection), SSD over USB
* Network cards: RJ 45 (Registered Jack 45)
* Wireless cards: IEEE 802.11
* Bluetooth: IEEE 802.15 (short-range wireless technology standard)
* Video accelerators: Hardware circuits on a graphics card that speed up full-motion video
* Audio cards

#### SSD vs HDD

* SSDs are faster, quieter, smaller, more durable, and consume less energy, while HDDs are cheaper and offer more storage capacity and easier data recovery if damaged.
* SSDs don't have moving parts, making them more durable.
* HDDs tend to last around 3-5 years, while SSDs can last up to 10 years or more.

#### Network cards vs Wireless cards

* NIC (Network Interface Card) provides network connectivity to Ethernet networks.
* Wireless Adapter Card provides wireless connectivity to networks enabled by Access Points.

### USB

Universal Serial Bus. Serial and needs fewer connections.

* USB 1 (12Mbps), USB 2 (480Mbps), USB 3 (up to 40Gbps)
* Types: A, B, C

### GPIO

General Purpose Input Output. Used to control other devices (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi).

## Sysfs

`sysfs` is a pseudo filesystem provided by the Linux kernel that exports information about various kernel subsystems, hardware devices, and associated device drivers to user space. It is mounted under `/sys`.

```bash
ls /sys
block  bus  class  dev  devices  firmware  fs  hypervisor  kernel  module  power
```

## udev

`udev` (userspace `/dev`) is a device manager for the Linux kernel. It manages device nodes in the `/dev` directory and handles events when hardware devices are added or removed.

`udev` allows control over device naming and actions triggered by device events.

```bash
ls /dev/sda*
/dev/sda  /dev/sda1  /dev/sda2  /dev/sda3
```

## dbus

`D-Bus` is a message bus system that provides inter-process communication and coordinates process lifecycles. It allows applications and daemons to launch on demand when their services are needed.

## proc Directory

The `/proc` directory contains kernel settings and properties. It is a virtual filesystem created on RAM.

* Examples:
  * IRQs (interrupt requests)
  * I/O ports
  * DMA (direct memory access)
  * Processes
  * Network settings

```bash
ls /proc
```

Some useful files in `/proc` include:

* `cpuinfo`: Processor information
* `meminfo`: Memory usage
* `mounts`: Mounted filesystems
* `ioports`: I/O port mappings

```bash
cat /proc/cpuinfo
```

Changes made in `/proc` are temporary and will be reverted after a reboot. To make changes permanent, write them to configuration files in `/etc/`.

## lsusb, lspci, lsblk, lshw

These commands provide hardware information:

### lspci

Lists PCI devices connected to the system:

```bash
lspci
```

### lsusb

Lists USB devices connected to the system:

```bash
lsusb
```

### lshw

Displays detailed information about hardware components. Requires root privileges for full output.

### lsblk

Lists devices that can read/write data in blocks:

```bash
lsblk
```

## Loadable Kernel Modules

Linux uses kernel modules to manage drivers. These modules are not loaded all at once to save memory. Modules can be managed with commands like `lsmod`, `modprobe`, and `rmmod`.

### lsmod

Displays loaded kernel modules:

```bash
lsmod
```

### modprobe

Adds or removes modules, handling dependencies automatically:

```bash
modprobe iwlwifi
```

To force module removal, use:

```bash
rmmod -f iwlwifi
```

To load modules at boot, add their names to `/etc/modules` or create configuration files in `/etc/modprobe.d/`.
