## Terms

* `dmesg`
* `journalctl`
* BIOS
* UEFI
* bootloader
* kernel
* `initramfs`
* `init`
* SysVinit
* systemd

## The Boot Process

It is important to understand because at this stage, you have very little control over the system and you cannot issue commands to troubleshoot much. You should have a good understanding of what is happening.

1. **Motherboard Firmware performs Power-On Self-Test (POST):** Checks hardware and system functionality.
2. **Motherboard loads the bootloader:** Loads and initializes the bootloader.
3. **Bootloader loads the Linux Kernel:** Based on its configuration/commands.
4. **Kernel loads and prepares the system:** Sets up the root filesystem and runs the initialization program.
5. **Init program starts services:** Such as web servers, graphical interfaces, networking, etc.

### BIOS

**Basic Input Output System:**

* Older technology.
* Limited to one sector of the disk and uses a multi-stage bootloader.
* Can start the bootloader from internal/external HDD, CD/DVD, USB flash drives, or network servers.
* Master Boot Record (MBR) is used when booting from HDD.

### UEFI

**Unified Extensible Firmware Interface:**

* Modern replacement for BIOS.
* Specifies a special disk partition for the bootloader, called the EFI System Partition (ESP).
* ESP is FAT and mounted on `/boot/efi`. Bootloader files have `.efi` extensions.

> Check `/sys/firmware/efi` to confirm UEFI usage.

### Bootloader

Bootloader initializes the minimum hardware needed to boot the system and locates and runs the OS.

* Commonly uses GRUB on GNU/Linux systems.

### Kernel

The Kernel is the core of your operating system. It is loaded into memory by the bootloader and needs initial information to start, such as drivers. These are stored in `initrd` or `initramfs` alongside the kernel.

* Parameters can be passed to the kernel at boot via GRUB.
  * Example: Single-user mode (`1` or `S`), graphics mode (`vga=792`).

### Logs and Diagnostics

#### `dmesg`

* Shows boot process logs stored in the Kernel Ring Buffer.
* Logs are stored in `/var/log/dmesg` after boot.
* Commands:
  ```bash
  dmesg
  journalctl -k  # Kernel logs
  journalctl -b  # Boot logs
  ```

#### Other Logs

* `/var/log/boot` or `/var/log/boot.log` (Debian/Red Hat systems).
* `/var/log/messages` or `/var/log/syslog` (system logs after boot).

## init

When the Kernel initialization is finished, it starts the Initialization Daemon process (`init`). This process starts other daemons, services, subsystems, and programs.

### Initialization Systems

* **SysVinit:**
  * Based on Unix System V.
  * Not widely used anymore.
  * Follows Unix principles.

* **Upstart:**
  * Event-based replacement for SysVinit developed by Canonical.
  * Discontinued due to the adoption of systemd.

* **Systemd:**
  * Modern replacement for SysVinit.
  * Widely adopted by major distributions.
  * Starts services in parallel and supports advanced configurations.

## systemd

Systemd is built around **units** (services, actions, etc.) with types like `service`, `target`, and `timer`.

* Commands:
  ```bash
  systemctl list-units
  systemctl start sshd
  systemctl stop sshd
  systemctl status sshd
  systemctl enable sshd
  systemctl disable sshd
  ```
* Unit files are located in:
  * `/etc/systemd/system/`
  * `/run/systemd/system/`
  * `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`
* Logs can be checked using:
  ```bash
  journalctl
  journalctl -u sshd  # Logs for a specific unit
  ```

## SysV

Older init system still used in some distributions.

* Control files are in `/etc/init.d/`.
* Commands:
  ```bash
  /etc/init.d/ntpd status
  /etc/init.d/ntpd stop
  /etc/init.d/ntpd start
  /etc/init.d/ntpd restart
  ```

Runlevels will be discussed further in section 101.3.
